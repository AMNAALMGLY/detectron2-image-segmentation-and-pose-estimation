# detectron2-image-segmentation-and-pose-estimation
Detectron2, an object detection library written in PyTorch. Detectron2 implements state-of-the-art object detection models, like the ones you learned about in lecture. It also provides a "model zoo" -- a library of models trained on a variety of datasets. This allows users to download models and apply them to their own images.
# Part A: Run a pre-trained model for instance segmentation
loads a Mask R-CNN model with a ResNet-50-FPN backbone pre-trained on the COCO dataset for the tasks of object detection and instance segmentation
 . COCO is a dataset of ~120k images annotated with bounding boxes and object segmentation masks for 80 object categories.
# Part B: Run a pre-trained model for pose estimation
the same as A but for pose estimation task
